This will be a summary of the individual accomplishments I have contributed to during the first week of the Labs8 Developer Maps Project. This blog post will be going over the many responsiblities and challenges I needed to overcome in order to work complete the necessary requirements for the week of 11/9/2018

## Server initialization and Firebase Data Structure

My primary responsibilities during the project involved dealing with and setting up the project's backend server. Much of my time spent during the first week was spent understanding the optimal ways to structure my data in Firebase's Realtime Database. Firebase's Realtime database is a NoSQL database which stores all of its data in a JSON Object. This was a major challenge consider I had never had experience with this type of database before and had to figure out how to structure my information in a way where I could access it without being able to rely on the complex querying functionality I had taken for granted in my time working with Relational Database Management Systems like SQLite. Once I tackled this problem, my next step was hooking our Firebase Realtime Database to our projects Node js backend as well as setting up the majority of its routes. Some objectives such as hooking up the Realtime Database to our Node js backend and setting up GET routes were pretty straight forward and did not take long once I had finished reading the docs. Routes involving updating the database however, weren't as easy and required reviewing my learning resources for Firebase multiple times.

* Well uncritical so misled
  * this is very interesting
* Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
